# Naive-Bayes Ml algorithm

+ Naive Bayes Classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.
Bayes' theorem is given by the following equation:

+ Using Bayes' theorem, the probability of A happening given that B has occurred can be found.
An example of the way a Naive Bayes Classifier can be used is, given that it has rained, the probability of temperature being low is P(Temperature|Rain)
